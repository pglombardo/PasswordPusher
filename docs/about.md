# About

Password Pusher is an application to communicate passwords over the web. Links to passwords expire after a certain number of views and/or time has passed.  Hosted at [pwpush.com](https://pwpush.com) or host your own.

The source code to this site is [on Github](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher). It's opensource and free for anyone to use or modify. Deploy it to the cloud, internally at your organization or just use pwpush.com. It's up to you.
