As we're coming up now on [10 years of Password Pusher](https://twitter.com/pwpush/status/1402331907824701447), there are some guiding principles that have always been followed but haven't been documented (until now).

As I continue to develop Password Pusher, adding new features and functionality, there are some tenets that I will continue to stay true to:

**1. Zero Distraction Password Reveal Page**

When you send users the secret link to a password, what is worse if those users are distracted and confused by the page they arrive at?  Could you imagine if there was advertising?  I would quickly switch away from that tool as soon as possible.

The end goal is to communicate a password to end users.  Some end users are more easily distracted and confused than others.  We always try to minimize these end user challenges.  :-)

So in this vein, we will always make sure to keep the password reveal page as simple and straight forward as possible.  That means **no branding**, **no links** and **no confusing text or designs**.

**2. An Accessible and Easy to Deploy Application**

Password Pusher is by origins an [opensource application](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher) that is often forked, modified and deployed internally (and externally) at various organizations.  This is great and as always I'll continue to support this as I've done in the past.

As of June 2021, we now have [automated docker builds](https://hub.docker.com/u/pglombardo) and support a [large number of deployment targets](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher#-run-your-own-instance).

**3. Prioritize features requested by the community of users**

This is mostly self-explanatory.  Most of the changes in the last few years were at the request of users.  This is great and will continue.

## What else?

Is there anything else you would like to see here?  [Let me know](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/issues/new).
