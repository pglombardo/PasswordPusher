# Global Application Defaults

# This is initially for internal settings.  If all goes well using
# this new config gem, then we'll migrate entirely to the new Settings
# format for private instances too.

# Logins are disabled by default since they require an MTA (email) server
# available to send emails through.
# For instructions on how to enable logins, see this page:
# https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher/discussions/276
enable_logins: false

# By default, Password Pusher can be used by anonymous users to push
# new passwords and generate secret URLs.  If you want to limit functionality
# to logged in  users only, set the following value to true.
#
# This does not affect password secret URLs themselves as anonymous is always
# allowed there.
#
# Environment variable override:
# PWP__ALLOW_ANONYMOUS='true'
#
allow_anonymous: true

# The domain (without protocol) where this instance is hosted
# Used in generating fully qualified URLs.
# host_domain: 'pwpush.com'

# The protocol to reach the domain above
# Used in generating fully qualified URLs.
host_protocol: 'https'

# Set the following value to force the base URL of generated links.
#
# Environment variable override:
# PWP__OVERRIDE_BASE_URL='https://pwpush.mydomain.com'
#
# You could even add a port if needed:
# PWP__OVERRIDE_BASE_URL='https://pwpush.mydomain.com:5100'
#
# Set this value without a trailing slash ('/').
#
# override_base_url: 'https://pwpush.mydomain.com'

# When logins are enabled, an SMTP server is required to send emails to users
# for things such as forgot password, unlock account, confirm account etc.
# If `enable_logins` is set to true above, the following _are required_ to be
# filled out with valid values.
mail:
  raise_delivery_errors: false
  # smtp_address: smtp.example.com
  # smtp_user_name: 'apikey'
  # smtp_password: ''
  smtp_port: 587
  smtp_authentication: 'plain'
  smtp_starttls: true
  smtp_open_timeout: 10
  smtp_read_timeout: 10

  # Configure the e-mail address which will be shown as 'From' in emails
  # See config/initializers/devise.rb where this is used
  # mailer_sender: '"Password Pusher" <pglombardo@pwpush.com>'
