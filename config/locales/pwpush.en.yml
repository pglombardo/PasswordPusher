    faq:
      answer_access_1: With the Password Pusher JSON API, there are a number of applications and command line utilities (CLI) that interface with pwpush.com or your self-hosted instance.  Push passwords from the CLI, Slack, Alfred App and more.
      answer_access_2: See the %{tools} page for more information.
      answer_add_feature_1: Very likely.  I love to hear all ideas and feedback and keep a list to decide what to add next.  If you have any, please submit them to the %{feedback_link} page or on %{github_link}.
      answer_already_expired_1: Some systems such as email, firewalls and chat systems often have link scanners that can eat up views.  This is usually done for corporate security or to simply generate a "preview" for applications.
      answer_already_expired_2: To prevent this, use the 1-click retrieval step option when pushing passwords.  This requires the users to click through a preliminary page to protect views from such scanners.
      answer_already_expired_3: As an additional preventative measure, when logged in, an audit log is provided for every push created.  This audit log reveals by who and when the push was viewed.
      answer_apnotic_1: Apnotic is the company created to manage Password Pusher (and to accept credit cards).  It is solely owned and managed by myself, Peter Giacomo Lombardo.
      answer_automation_1: Yes.  The Password Pusher JSON API allows for the automation of password pushing.  This can be done with a variety of programming languages and tools.
      answer_automation_2: See the %{tools} page for more information.
      answer_conference_1: Absolutely.  We have media resources and a full explanation of features available in %{windows_link} and %{mac_link} formats.
      answer_conference_2: If you have any questions or need any help, feel free to contact me anytime.
      answer_files_free: |
        I really tried to keep file based pushes free but because of some abuse, risk and growing hosting costs. I didn't have much choice.

        If you are an individual or student and really can't afford the $8/month, message me and I will see what I can do.  At a minimum, a credit card will be required even though it won't be charged.

        If you are a non-profit or an educational institution, send me a message on the feedback form, explain your needs and I might be able to grant you a premium or pro account for free.
        <br/>
        If you are part of a for-profit company, I humbly ask for your support in the form of a subscription.
      answer_how_many_1: There are no limits currently and I have no intention of adding any.  To minimally assure site stability, Password Pusher is configured with a rate limiter by default.  This can be disabled in the self-hosted version.
      answer_licensing_1: The source code of the open source version is released under the Apache 2.0 License and that pretty much defines any and all limitations. There are quite a few re-branded and redesigned clone sites across the internet and hosted internally I welcome them all.
      answer_licensing_2: |
        pwpush.com hosts a premium version of Password Pusher with a super-set of features beyond the open source project.  pwpush.com is free to use but offers subscriptions for the premium and pro features such as teams, invites, custom domains etc...
        <br/>
        A Pro self-hosted version is coming soon.  It will be available under a commercial license.
      answer_premium_diff: See the %{link} for a full list of differences between the open source and premium versions.
      answer_private_risks_1: Running a private instance of Password Pusher for your company or organization gives you the peace of mind that you know exactly what code is running.  You can configure and run it as you like.
      answer_private_risks_2: On the other hand, if your instance gets hacked and the encryption broken, malicious entities now have a targeted dictionary of passwords to brute force accounts in your organization.  (this would be limited to pushes which haven't expired yet)
      answer_private_risks_3: In this respect, the public instance at pwpush.com may be superior in that it contains only passwords without identifying information mixed among users from around the globe.
      answer_private_risks_4: One other consideration would be the maintenance of the instance.  You need to keep it updated, secure and backed up.
      answer_private_risks_5: The user should carefully weigh the pros and cons and decide which route is best for them.  We happily support both strategies.
      answer_purpose_1: Password Pusher exists as a better alternative to emailing passwords.
      answer_purpose_10: Additionally, <strong>passwords expire after a predefined set of views are hit or time passed.</strong>
      answer_purpose_11: Once expired, passwords are unequivocally deleted.
      answer_purpose_12: If that sounds interesting to you, try it out or see the other frequently asked questions below.
      answer_purpose_2: "<strong>Emailing passwords is inherently insecure.</strong> The greatest risks include:"
      answer_purpose_3: Emailed passwords are usually sent with context to what they go to or can potentially be derived from email username, domain etc…
      answer_purpose_4: Email is inherently insecure and can be intercepted at multiple points by malicious entities.
      answer_purpose_5: 'Emailed passwords live in perpetuity (read: forever) in email archives.'
      answer_purpose_6: Passwords in email can be retrieved and used later on if an email account is stolen, cracked etc..
      answer_purpose_7: The same risks exist when sending passwords via SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram, Chat etc…  The data can and is often kept in perpetuity and out of your control.
      answer_purpose_8: By using Password Pusher, you bypass all of this.
      answer_purpose_9: For each password posted to Password Pusher, <strong>a unique URL is generated that only you will know</strong>.
      answer_rebranding_1: Password Pusher supports complete re-branding "out of the box" allowing you to add a custom logo, images, text and even change the application theme.
      answer_self_host_1: Yes, for the open source version, we provide %{docker_link} and %{install_link} for a wide variety of platforms and clouds.
      answer_self_host_2: For the premium version, with the super-set of features, self-hosted containers are coming soon.
      answer_trust_2: Password Pusher exists as a better alternative to emailing passwords. It avoids having passwords exist in email & messaging archives in perpetuity. It does not exist as a end-all security solution.
      answer_trust_3: Password Pusher started as an open source project at the end of 2011.  It has been maintained & updated by myself (Peter Giacomo Lombardo) and a handful of excellent contributors for all of that time.  In 2024, the premium version was introduced to accelerate development and to help fund the project.  All premium features end up in the open source version eventually.
      answer_trust_4: By having such a long history and being open source, Password Pusher has been reviewed by many eyes.  It has been used by and audited many organizations and individuals over the years.
      answer_trust_6: Push payloads are deleted entirely on expiration and the audit log is maintained indefinitely.  The less data Password Pusher holds, the better.
      answer_trust_7: If you still have concerns regarding trust, safety and security, feel free to review the code, post any questions that you may have and consider running it internally at your organization instead.
      answer_trust_8: As for trust in me, all I can offer is my long history building this project and my public reputation on %{github}, %{linkedin}, %{twitter} and %{blog}.  Feel free to contact me anytime with any questions you may have.
      answer_why_premium_1: |
        Password Pusher has been very fortunate in it's popularity and growth over the years.  I've enjoyed every moment of building it and working with the community to make it better.
        After 13 years, the project has hit a point where there are now more feature requests than I can handle doing this only nights and weekends.  On top of that, monthly hosting costs have also increased to a point where it's starting to hurt a bit.
      answer_why_premium_2: I introduced the premium version to help fund the project and to accelerate development.  The super-set of features in the premium versions are meant to be a value-add for organizations that need more than the open-source version provides.  As Password Pusher is built out, the premium features will be moved to the open-source version after a period of time depending on the feature.
      answer_why_private_1: Some organizations are bound by security policies that prohibit the use of public services for sensitive information such as passwords.  There are even organizations that require all tools to be on private intranets without access to the outside world.
      answer_why_private_2: Running your own private instance of Password Pusher allows you to control the environment and the data.  It also allows you to add custom features and integrations that are specific to your organization.
      answer_why_private_3: It's for these reasons that we provide the ability (and encourage) users and organizations to run private instances when needed.
      answer_will_oss: |
        Absolutely - the premium version allows me to spend more time on the project.
        The final destination for all work is to be in the open source version of the project eventually.

      intro: This page is used as a helper tool to generate a random encryption key for self-hosted instances of Password Pusher.
      intro_2: Password Pusher encrypts sensitive data in the database.  Although there is a default key included, it's best practice to use your own custom encryption key.
      intro_3: With each refresh, this page generates a new encryption key.  You can use the randomly generated code below to configure your Password Pusher instance.
      note_1: If an encryption key isn't provided, a default key will be used.
      note_2: The best security for private instances of Password Pusher is to use your own custom encryption key although it is not required.
      note_3: The risk in using the default key is lessened if you keep your instance secure and your push expirations short.  e.g.  1 day/1 view versus 100 days/100 views.
      note_4: Once a push expires, all encrypted data in that push is deleted.
      note_5: Changing an encryption key where old pushes already exist will make those older pushes unreadable.  In other words, the payloads will be garbled.  New pushes going forward will work fine.
      note_6: 'Key generation can also be done from the command line in the application source by executing:'
